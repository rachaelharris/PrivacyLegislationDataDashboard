#### Questions
Please anticipate at least 500 words for this writing assignment.


+ Briefly describe their prototype tool.

A type of hashing algorithm. The tool is going to take in some input, hash it, and and give the users an output, which is a hash. This will be checked, as you can put the input in other website, and it should give the same output. This will use an already-existing hashing algorithm. There are a few options: the prototype might use multiple hashing algorithms, though, at minimum, it will implement at least SHA-1 or SHA-2; to do a collision on better hashing algorithms, Michael would need acccess to a supercomputer. 

+ Were you able to follow documentation and use the tool? If not, outline the challenges that you faced. Post them as issues in their repository.

The documentation is not present for the tool; Michael still is doing a lot of preliminary research, so the "documentation" that he has is mostly research so far on how to implement his ideas. This, to my understanding, is readable and will eventually contain a kind of pseudocode and code with proper documentation.

+ What has been completed?

Initial primary research on hashing algorithms and how to implement them. Michael has been making a lot of careful decisions and consideration about how, exactly, to implement a project like this. I think this is a good first step, rather than jumping into something too soon. He's been making some careful impact calculations to determine the feasibility--not just that he can do it--but that he will have adequate resources to perform such a task. He has been in talks with Cryptography professors, Mathematics professors, and Computer Science professors, which is giving his project a much more well-rounded approach. He most certainly is not taking this lightly, and wants this to be one of the best projects that he has worked on in his time here, which I greatly respect.

+ What remains to be implemented for the prototype to be ready for a demo?

Proper code and documentation. After the fall from this first domino, I think that Michael will hit the ground running, as it were, with this code. I have seen him work on encryption and cryptography algorithms before, so I know that he has the capability to do such a project. I truly believe that once this falls into place, he will get everything done very shortly after. 

+ What suggestions do you have?

To write the code and documentation. And to branch out talking to other professors from other universities, if he can, to get an even bigger perspective. To identify his audience and his goals for this project. What does he intend for this to do? How does he intend for this to be used? Will he sell something like this to a larger corperation or use it as the foundation for a graduate level thesis or project? Will he eventually try to develop his own encryption algorithm?
