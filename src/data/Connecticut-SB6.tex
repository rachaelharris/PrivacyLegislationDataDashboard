242 Sec. 4. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A consumer shall have the
243 right to: (1) Confirm whether or not a controller is processing the
244 consumer's personal data and to access such personal data; (2) correct
245 inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the
246 nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the
247 consumer's personal data; (3) delete personal data provided by, or

252 processing is carried out by automated means; and (5) opt out of the

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 10 of 24
269 on the consumer's behalf.
270 (c) Except as otherwise provided in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this
271 act, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise
272 the consumer rights authorized pursuant to said sections as follows:
273 (1) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay,
274 but not later than forty-five days after receipt of the request. The
275 controller may extend the response period by forty-five additional days
276 when reasonably necessary, considering the complexity and number of
277 the consumer's requests, provided the controller informs the consumer
278 of any such extension within the initial forty-five-day response period,
279 together with the reason for the extension.
280 (2) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's
281 request, the controller shall inform the consumer without undue delay,
282 but not later than forty-five days after receipt of the request, of the
283 justification for declining to take action and instructions for how to
284 appeal the decision.
285 (3) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be
286 provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per
287 consumer. If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded,
288 excessive or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a
289 reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the
290 request or decline to act on the request. The controller bears the burden
291 of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive or repetitive
292 nature of the request.
293 (4) If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using
294 commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to
295 comply with a request to initiate an action pursuant to this section and
296 shall provide notice to the consumer that the controller is unable to
297 authenticate the request until the consumer provides additional
298 information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the
299 consumer's request.

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 11 of 24
300 (d) A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the
301 controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period
302 of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision. The appeal process
303 shall be conspicuously available and similar to the process for
304 submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to this section. Not later
305 than sixty days after receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the
306 consumer in writing of any action taken or not taken in response to the
307 appeal, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decisions.
308 If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer
309 with an online mechanism, if available, or other method through which
310 the consumer may contact the Attorney General to submit a complaint.
311 Sec. 5. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) A consumer may designate
312 another person to serve as the consumer's authorized agent, and act on
313 such consumer's behalf, to opt out of the processing of such consumer's
314 personal data for one or more of the purposes specified in subdivision
315 (5) of subsection (a) of section 4 of this act. The consumer may designate
316 such authorized agent by way of, among other things, a technology,
317 including, but not limited to, an Internet link or a browser setting,
318 browser extension or global device setting, indicating such consumer's
319 intent to opt out of such processing. A controller shall comply with an
320 opt-out request received from an authorized agent if the controller is
321 able to authenticate, with commercially reasonable effort, the identity of
322 the consumer and the authorized agent's authority to act on such
323 consumer's behalf.
324 Sec. 6. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A controller shall: (1) Limit
325 the collection of personal data to what is adequate, relevant and
326 reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which such data is
327 processed, as disclosed to the consumer; (2) except as otherwise
328 provided in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act, not process personal
329 data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to, nor
330 compatible with, the disclosed purposes for which such personal data is
331 processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains
332 the consumer's consent; (3) establish, implement and maintain 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 12 of 24
333 reasonable administrative, technical and physical data security practices
334 to protect the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of personal data
335 appropriate to the volume and nature of the personal data at issue; (4)
336 not process sensitive data concerning a consumer without obtaining the
337 consumer's consent, or, in the case of the processing of sensitive data
338 concerning a known child, without processing such data in accordance
339 with COPPA; (5) not process personal data in violation of the laws of
340 this state and federal laws that prohibit unlawful discrimination against
341 consumers; (6) provide an effective mechanism for a consumer to revoke
342 the consumer's consent under this section that is at least as easy as the
343 mechanism by which the consumer provided the consumer's consent
344 and, upon revocation of such consent, cease to process the data as soon
345 as practicable, but not later than fifteen days after the receipt of such
346 request; and (7) not process the personal data of a consumer for
347 purposes of targeted advertising, or sell the consumer's personal data
348 without the consumer's consent, under circumstances where a controller
349 has actual knowledge of, or wilfully disregards, that the consumer is at
350 least thirteen years of age but younger than eighteen years of age. A
351 controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any
352 of the consumer rights contained in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act,
353 including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates
354 for goods or services or providing a different level of quality of goods
355 and services to the consumer.
356 (b) Nothing in subsection (a) of this section shall be construed to
357 require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the
358 personal data of a consumer which the controller does not collect or
359 maintain, or prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate,
360 level, quality or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including
361 offering goods or services for no fee, if the offering is in connection with
362 a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards,
363 premium features, discounts or club card program. If a consumer
364 exercises the consumer's right to opt out pursuant to subdivision (5) of
365 subsection (a) of section 4 of this act, a controller may not sell the
366 consumer's personal data to a third party as part of such program 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 13 of 24
367 unless: (1) The sale is reasonably necessary to enable the third party to
368 provide a benefit to which the consumer is entitled; (2) the sale of
369 personal data to third parties is clearly disclosed in the terms of the
370 program; and (3) the third party uses the personal data only for
371 purposes of facilitating such a benefit to which the consumer is entitled
372 and does not retain or otherwise use or disclose the personal data for
373 any other purpose.
374 (c) A controller shall provide consumers with a reasonably accessible,
375 clear and meaningful privacy notice that includes: (1) The categories of
376 personal data processed by the controller; (2) the purpose for processing
377 personal data; (3) how consumers may exercise their consumer rights,
378 including how a consumer may appeal a controller's decision with
379 regard to the consumer's request; (4) the categories of personal data that
380 the controller shares with third parties, if any; (5) the categories of third
381 parties, if any, with which the controller shares personal data; and (6)
382 an active electronic mail address that the consumer may use to contact
383 the controller.
384 (d) If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes
385 personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and
386 conspicuously disclose such processing, as well as the manner in which
387 a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of such processing.
388 (e) A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice,
389 one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a
390 request to exercise their consumer rights pursuant to sections 1 to 11,
391 inclusive, of this act. Such means shall take into account the ways in
392 which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for
393 secure and reliable communication of such requests and the ability of
394 the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the
395 request. A controller shall not require a consumer to create a new
396 account in order to exercise consumer rights, but may require a
397 consumer to use an existing account. Any such means shall include:
398 (1) (A) Providing a clear and conspicuous link on the controller's 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 14 of 24
399 Internet web site to an Internet web page that enables a consumer, or an
400 agent of the consumer, to opt out of the targeted advertising or sale of
401 the consumer's personal data; and
402 (B) During the period beginning July 1, 2023, and ending December
403 31, 2024, allowing a consumer to opt out of, and, beginning January 1,
404 2025, requiring a consumer to opt in or opt out of, the processing of
405 personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising or the sale of
406 personal data through an opt-in or opt-out preference, as applicable,
407 signal sent with the consumer's consent by a platform, technology or
408 mechanism to the controller indicating the consumer's intent to opt-in
409 or opt-out, as applicable, of processing data for targeted advertising or
410 the sale of the consumer's personal data. An opt-out preference signal
411 mechanism provided pursuant to this subsection shall:
412 (i) Not permit the manufacturer of a platform, browser, device or any
413 other product offering a universal opt-out mechanism to unfairly
414 disadvantage another controller;
415 (ii) Require controllers to inform consumers about the opt-out choices
416 available under sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act;
417 (iii) Not adapt a mechanism that is a default setting, but rather clearly
418 represent the consumer's affirmative, freely given and unambiguous
419 choice to opt out of the processing of personal data pursuant to sections
420 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act;
421 (iv) Be consumer-friendly, clearly described and easy to use by the
422 average consumer;
423 (v) Be as consistent as possible with any other similar mechanism
424 required by any federal or state law or regulation; and
425 (vi) Permit the controller to accurately authenticate the consumer as
426 a resident of this state and determine that the mechanism represents a
427 legitimate request to opt out of the sale of personal data.

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 15 of 24
428 (2) If a controller responds to consumer opt‐out requests received
429 pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection by informing the
430 consumer of a charge for the use of any product or service, the controller
431 shall present the terms of any financial incentive offered pursuant to
432 subsection (b) of this section for the retention, use, sale or sharing of the
433 consumer's personal data.
434 Sec. 7. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A processor shall adhere to
435 the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller in meeting
436 the controller's obligations under sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act.
437 Such assistance shall include: (1) Taking into account the nature of
438 processing and the information available to the processor, by
439 appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as is
440 reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to
441 consumer rights requests; (2) taking into account the nature of
442 processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting
443 the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the
444 security of processing the personal data and in relation to the
445 notification of a breach of security, as defined in section 36a-701b of the
446 general statutes, of the system of the processor, in order to meet the
447 controller's obligations; and (3) providing necessary information to
448 enable the controller to conduct and document data protection
449 assessments.
450 (b) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the
451 processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing
452 performed on behalf of the controller. The contract shall be binding and
453 clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose
454 of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of
455 processing and the rights and obligations of both parties. The contract
456 shall also require that the processor: (1) Ensure that each person
457 processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with
458 respect to the data; (2) at the controller's direction, delete or return all
459 personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision
460 of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law; (3) 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 16 of 24
461 upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the
462 controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the
463 processor's compliance with the obligations in sections 1 to 11, inclusive,
464 of this act; (4) engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract
465 that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor
466 with respect to the personal data; and (5) allow, and cooperate with,
467 reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated
468 assessor, or the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent
469 assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and
470 technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations
471 under sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act, using an appropriate and
472 accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for
473 such assessments. The processor shall provide a report of such
474 assessment to the controller upon request.
475 (c) Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or
476 processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by
477 virtue of such controller's or processor's role in the processing
478 relationship, as described in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act.
479 (d) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or
480 processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based
481 determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is
482 to be processed. A person who is not limited in such person's processing
483 of personal data pursuant to a controller's instructions, or who fails to
484 adhere to such instructions, is a controller and not a processer with
485 respect to a specific processing of data. A processor that continues to
486 adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing
487 of personal data remains a processor. If a processor begins, alone or
488 jointly with others, determining the purposes and means of the
489 processing of personal data, the processor is a controller with respect to
490 such processing.
491 Sec. 8. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) A controller shall conduct and
492 document a data protection assessment for each of the controller's 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 17 of 24
493 processing activities that presents a heightened risk of harm to a
494 consumer. For the purposes of this section, processing that presents a
495 heightened risk of harm to a consumer includes: (1) The processing of
496 personal data for the purposes of targeted advertising; (2) the sale of
497 personal data; (3) the processing of personal data for the purposes of
498 profiling, where such profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of
499 (A) unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on,
500 consumers, (B) financial, physical or reputational injury to consumers,
501 (C) a physical or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the
502 private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where such intrusion would
503 be offensive to a reasonable person, or (D) other substantial injury to
504 consumers; and (4) the processing of sensitive data.
505 (b) Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (a)
506 of this section shall identify and weigh the benefits that may flow,
507 directly and indirectly, from the processing to the controller, the
508 consumer, other stakeholders and the public against the potential risks
509 to the rights of the consumer associated with such processing, as
510 mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to
511 reduce such risks. The controller shall factor into any such data
512 protection assessment the use of de-identified data and the reasonable
513 expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and
514 the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose
515 personal data will be processed.
516 (c) The Attorney General may require that a controller disclose any
517 data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation
518 conducted by the Attorney General, and the controller shall make the
519 data protection assessment available to the Attorney General. The
520 Attorney General may evaluate the data protection assessment for
521 compliance with the responsibilities set forth in sections 1 to 11,
522 inclusive, of this act. Data protection assessments shall be confidential
523 and shall be exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information
524 Act, as defined in section 1-200 of the general statutes. To the extent any
525 information contained in a data protection assessment disclosed to the 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 18 of 24
526 Attorney General includes information subject to attorney-client
527 privilege or work product protection, such disclosure shall not
528 constitute a waiver of such privilege or protection.
529 (d) A single data protection assessment may address a comparable
530 set of processing operations that include similar activities.
531 (e) If a controller conducts a data protection assessment for the
532 purpose of complying with another applicable law or regulation, the
533 data protection assessment shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements
534 established in this section if such data protection assessment is
535 reasonably similar in scope and effect to the data protection assessment
536 that would otherwise be conducted pursuant to this section.
537 (f) Data protection assessment requirements shall apply to processing
538 activities created or generated after July 1, 2023, and are not retroactive.
539 Sec. 9. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) Any controller in possession
540 of de-identified data shall: (1) Take reasonable measures to ensure that
541 the data cannot be associated with an individual; (2) publicly commit to
542 maintaining and using de-identified data without attempting to re543 identify the data; and (3) contractually obligate any recipients of the de544 identified data to comply with all provisions of sections 1 to 11,
545 inclusive, of this act.
546 (b) Nothing in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
547 to: (1) Require a controller or processor to re-identify de-identified data
548 or pseudonymous data; or (2) maintain data in identifiable form, or
549 collect, obtain, retain or access any data or technology, in order to be
550 capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal
551 data.
552 (c) Nothing in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
553 to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated
554 consumer rights request if the controller: (1) Is not reasonably capable
555 of associating the request with the personal data or it would be 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 19 of 24
556 unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request
557 with the personal data; (2) does not use the personal data to recognize
558 or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal
559 data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the
560 same specific consumer; and (3) does not sell the personal data to any
561 third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any
562 third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this
563 section.
564 (d) Consumer rights shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases
565 where the controller is able to demonstrate any information necessary
566 to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective
567 technical and organizational controls that prevent the controller from
568 accessing such information.
569 (e) A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or de-identified
570 data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any
571 contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de572 identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any
573 breaches of those contractual commitments.
574 Sec. 10. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) Nothing in sections 1 to 11,
575 inclusive, of this act shall be construed to restrict a controller's or
576 processor's ability to: (1) Comply with federal, state or municipal
577 ordinances or regulations; (2) comply with a civil, criminal or regulatory
578 inquiry, investigation, subpoena or summons by federal, state,
579 municipal or other governmental authorities; (3) cooperate with law
580 enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the controller
581 or processor reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal,
582 state or municipal ordinances or regulations; (4) investigate, establish,
583 exercise, prepare for or defend legal claims; (5) provide a product or
584 service specifically requested by a consumer; (6) perform a contract to
585 which a consumer is a party, including fulfilling the terms of a written
586 warranty; (7) take steps at the request of a consumer prior to entering
587 into a contract; (8) take immediate steps to protect an interest that is 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 20 of 24
588 essential for the life or physical safety of the consumer or another
589 individual, and where the processing cannot be manifestly based on
590 another legal basis; (9) prevent, detect, protect against or respond to
591 security incidents, identity theft, fraud, harassment, malicious or
592 deceptive activities or any illegal activity, preserve the integrity or
593 security of systems or investigate, report or prosecute those responsible
594 for any such action; (10) engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific or
595 statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other
596 applicable ethics and privacy laws and is approved, monitored and
597 governed by an institutional review board, or similar independent
598 oversight entities, that determines (A) if the deletion of the information
599 is likely to provide substantial benefits that do not exclusively accrue to
600 the controller, (B) the expected benefits of the research outweigh the
601 privacy risks, and (C) if the controller has implemented reasonable
602 safeguards to mitigate privacy risks associated with research, including
603 any risks associated with re-identification; (11) assist another controller,
604 processor or third party with any of the obligations under sections 1 to
605 11, inclusive, of this act; or (12) process personal data for reasons of
606 public interest in the area of public health, but solely to the extent that
607 such processing is (A) subject to suitable and specific measures to
608 safeguard the rights of the consumer whose personal data is being
609 processed, and (B) under the responsibility of a professional subject to
610 confidentiality obligations under federal, state or local law.
611 (b) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
612 sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall not restrict a controller's or
613 processor's ability to collect, use or retain data for internal use to: (1)
614 Conduct internal research to develop, improve or repair products,
615 services or technology; (2) effectuate a product recall; (3) identify and
616 repair technical errors that impair existing or intended functionality; or
617 (4) perform internal operations that are reasonably aligned with the
618 expectations of the consumer or reasonably anticipated based on the
619 consumer's existing relationship with the controller, or are otherwise
620 compatible with processing data in furtherance of the provision of a
621 product or service specifically requested by a consumer or the 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 21 of 24
622 performance of a contract to which the consumer is a party.
623 (c) The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under
624 sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall not apply where compliance
625 by the controller or processor with said sections would violate an
626 evidentiary privilege under the laws of this state. Nothing in sections 1
627 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed to prevent a controller or
628 processor from providing personal data concerning a consumer to a
629 person covered by an evidentiary privilege under the laws of the state
630 as part of a privileged communication.
631 (d) A controller or processor that discloses personal data to a third632 party controller or processor, in compliance with the requirements of
633 sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act, is not in violation of said sections
634 if the third-party controller or processor that receives and processes
635 such personal data is in violation of said sections, provided, at the time
636 of disclosing the personal data, the disclosing controller or processor did
637 not have reason to believe that the recipient would violate said sections.
638 A third-party controller or processor receiving personal data from a
639 controller or processor in compliance with the requirements of sections
640 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act is likewise not in violation of said sections
641 for the transgressions of the controller or processor from which such
642 third-party controller or processor receives such personal data.
643 (e) Nothing in sections 1 to 11, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
644 as an obligation imposed on controllers and processors that adversely
645 affects the rights or freedoms of any persons, such as exercising the right
646 to freedom of speech under the First Amendment to the United States
647 Constitution, or applies to the processing of personal data by a person
648 in the course of a purely personal or household activity.
649 (f) Personal data processed by a controller pursuant to this section
650 may be processed to the extent that such processing is: (1) Reasonably
651 necessary and proportionate to the purposes listed in this section; and
652 (2) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the
653 specific purposes listed in this section. Personal data collected, used or 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 22 of 24
654 retained pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall, where
655 applicable, take into account the nature and purpose or purposes of such
656 collection, use or retention. Such data shall be subject to reasonable
657 administrative, technical and physical measures to protect the
658 confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of the personal data and to
659 reduce reasonably foreseeable risks of harm to consumers relating to
660 such collection, use or retention of personal data.
661 (g) If a controller processes personal data pursuant to an exemption
662 in this section, the controller bears the burden of demonstrating that
663 such processing qualifies for the exemption and complies with the
664 requirements in subsection (f) of this section.
665 (h) Processing personal data for the purposes expressly identified in
666 this section shall not solely make a legal entity a controller with respect
667 to such processing.
668 Sec. 11. (NEW) (Effective July 1, 2023) (a) The Attorney General shall
669 have exclusive authority to enforce violations of sections 1 to 10,
670 inclusive, of this act.
671 (b) During the period beginning on July 1, 2023, and ending on
672 December 31, 2024, the Attorney General shall, prior to initiating any
673 action for a violation of any provision of sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of
674 this act, issue a notice of violation to the controller if the Attorney
675 General determines that a cure is possible. If the controller fails to cure
676 such violation within sixty days of receipt of the notice of violation, the
677 Attorney General may bring an action pursuant to this section.
678 (c) Nothing in sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of this act shall be construed
679 as providing the basis for, or be subject to, a private right of action for
680 violations of said sections or any other law.
681 (d) A violation of the requirements of sections 1 to 10, inclusive, of
682 this act shall constitute an unfair trade practice for purposes of section
683 42-110b of the general statutes and shall be enforced solely by the 

Committee Bill No. 6
LCO No. 1770 23 of 24
684 Attorney General, provided the provisions of section 42-110g of the
685 general statutes shall not apply to such violation.
This act shall take effect as follows and shall amend the following
sections:
