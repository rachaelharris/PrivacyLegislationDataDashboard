41 to commit such a violation.
42 ยง9607. Consumer's right to prohibit sale; right to opt out
Page 11 - 130LR2336(01)
1 1. Right to opt out. A consumer has the right, at any time, to direct a business that
2 sells personal information about the consumer to 3rd parties not to sell the consumer's
3 personal information. This right may be referred to as "the right to opt out."
4 2. Notice of right to opt out. A business that sells consumers' personal information
5 to 3rd parties shall provide notice to consumers, pursuant to section 9610, subsection 1,
6 that this information may be sold and that consumers have the right to opt out of the sale
7 of their personal information.
8 3. Right to opt in; consumer's age. Notwithstanding subsection 1, a business may
9 not sell the personal information of a consumer if the business has actual knowledge that
10 the consumer is less than 16 years of age, unless the consumer, in the case of a consumer
11 at least 13 years of age and less than 16 years of age, or the consumer's parent or guardian,
12 in the case of a consumer less than 13 years of age, has affirmatively authorized the sale of
13 the consumer's personal information. A business that willfully disregards the consumer's
14 age is deemed to have had actual knowledge of the consumer's age.
15 The affirmative authorization required under this subsection may be referred to as "the right
16 to opt in."
17 4. Sale prohibited. A business that has received direction from a consumer not to sell
18 the consumer's personal information or, in the case of a minor consumer's personal
19 information has not received consent to sell the minor consumer's personal information, is
20 prohibited, pursuant to section 9610, subsection 1, paragraph D, from selling the
21 consumer's personal information after its receipt of the consumer's direction, unless the
22 consumer subsequently provides express authorization for the sale of the consumer's
23 personal information.
24 ยง9608. Business practices
25 1. Discrimination based on exercise of rights prohibited. A business may not
26 discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercised any of the consumer's
27 rights under this chapter, including, but not limited to, by:
28 A. Denying goods or services to the consumer;
29 B. Charging different prices or rates for goods or services, including through the use
30 of discounts or other benefits or imposing penalties;
31 C. Providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer; or
32 D. Suggesting that the consumer will receive a different price or rate for goods or
33 services or a different level or quality of goods or services.
34 Nothing in this subsection prohibits a business from charging a consumer a different price
35 or rate, or from providing a different level or quality of goods or services to the consumer,
36 if that difference is reasonably related to the value provided to the business by the
37 consumer's personal information.
38 2. Financial incentives. A business may offer financial incentives, including
39 payments to consumers as compensation, for the collection of personal information, the
40 sale of personal information or the deletion of personal information. A business may also
41 offer a different price, rate, level or quality of goods or services to the consumer if that
42 price or difference is directly related to the value provided to the business by the consumer's
43 personal information.
Page 12 - 130LR2336(01)
1 A. A business that offers any financial incentives pursuant to this subsection shall
2 notify consumers of the financial incentives pursuant to section 9609.
3 B. A business may enter a consumer into a financial incentive program only if the
4 consumer gives the business prior opt in consent pursuant to section 9609 that clearly
5 describes the material terms of the financial incentive program, and which may be
6 revoked by the consumer at any time.
7 C. A business may not use financial incentive practices that are unjust, unreasonable,
8 coercive or usurious in nature.
9 ยง9609. Requests for and disclosure of information
10 1. Requests; disclosure and delivery. In order to comply with sections 9603, 9604,
11 9605, 9606 and 9608, a business shall, in a form that is reasonably accessible to consumers:
12 A. Make available to consumers 2 or more designated methods for submitting requests
13 for information required to be disclosed pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606, including,
14 at a minimum, a toll-free telephone number.
15 (1) A business that operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with
16 a consumer from whom it collects personal information is required to provide only
17 an e-mail address for submitting requests for information required to be disclosed
18 pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606.
19 (2) If the business maintains an Internet website, the business shall make the
20 Internet website available to consumers to submit requests for information required
21 to be disclosed pursuant to sections 9605 and 9606;
22 B. Disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge within
23 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request from the consumer. The business
24 shall promptly take steps to determine whether the request is a verifiable consumer
25 request, but this does not extend the business's duty to disclose and deliver the
26 information within 45 days of receipt of the consumer's request. The time period to
27 provide the required information may be extended once by an additional 45 days when
28 reasonably necessary, if the consumer is provided notice of the extension within the
29 first 45-day period. The disclosure must cover at least the 12-month period preceding
30 the business's receipt of the verifiable consumer request and must be made in writing
31 and delivered through the consumer's account with the business, if the consumer
32 maintains an account with the business, or by mail or electronically at the consumer's
33 option if the consumer does not maintain an account with the business, in a readily
34 useable format that allows the consumer to transmit this information from one entity
35 to another entity without hindrance. The business may require authentication of the
36 consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested,
37 but may not require the consumer to create an account with the business in order to
38 make a verifiable consumer request. If the consumer maintains an account with the
39 business, the business may require the consumer to submit the request through that
40 account;
41 C. For purposes of section 9605, subsection 2:
42 (1) To identify the consumer, associate the information provided by the consumer

44 by the business about the consumer; and
Page 13 - 130LR2336(01)

18 that the business disclosed for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months by
19 reference to the enumerated category or categories in subsection 3 that most closely

21 whom the consumer's personal information was disclosed for a business purpose

24 business shall disclose the information in a list that is separate from a list generated
25 for the purposes of subparagraph (2);
26 E. Disclose the following information in its online privacy policy or policies if the
27 business has an online privacy policy or policies and in any description of consumers'
28 privacy rights specific to the State or, if the business does not maintain those policies,

41 sold or, if the business has not sold consumers' personal information in the
42 preceding 12 months, the business shall disclose that fact; and
43 (b) A list of the categories of personal information it has disclosed about
44 consumers for a business purpose in the preceding 12 months by reference to

33 direct the business not to sell the consumer's personal information;
34 B. Include a description of a consumer's rights pursuant to section 9607, along with a
35 separate link to the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" Internet webpage in:

38 as defined in section 1171, subsection 10, if the vehicle information or ownership
39 information is shared for the purpose of effectuating, or in anticipation of effectuating, a
40 vehicle repair covered by a vehicle warranty or a recall conducted pursuant to 49 United
41 States Code, Sections 30118 to 30120, as long as the new motor vehicle dealer or vehicle

18 because of their repetitive character, a business may either charge a reasonable fee,
19 taking into account the administrative costs of providing the information or
20 communication or taking the action requested, or refuse to act on the request and notify
21 the consumer of the reason for refusing the request. The business shall bear the burden
22 of demonstrating that any verifiable consumer request is manifestly unfounded or
23 excessive.
24 8. Disclosure to service provider. A business that discloses personal information to
25 a service provider is not liable under this chapter if the service provider receiving the
26 personal information uses it in violation of the restrictions set forth in this chapter, if, at the
27 time of disclosing the personal information, the business does not have actual knowledge

27 ยง9614. Civil action based on violation
28 1. Civil action based on violation. A consumer whose nonencrypted and nonredacted
29 personal information is subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft or
30 disclosure as a result of the business's violation of the duty to implement and maintain
31 reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information to
32 protect the personal information may institute a civil action for any of the following:
33 A. To recover damages in an amount not less than $100 and not greater than $750 per
34 consumer per incident or actual damages, whichever is greater;
35 B. Injunctive or declaratory relief; and
36 C. Any other relief the court determines proper.
37 In assessing the amount of statutory damages, the court shall consider any one or more of
38 the relevant circumstances presented by any of the parties to the case, including, but not
39 limited to, the nature and seriousness of the misconduct, the number of violations, the
40 persistence of the misconduct, the length of time over which the misconduct occurred, the
41 willfulness of the defendant's misconduct and the defendant's assets, liabilities and net
42 worth.
Page 21 - 130LR2336(01)
1 2. Notice of alleged violation; opportunity to cure; exception. Actions pursuant to
2 this section may be brought by a consumer if, prior to initiating any action against a
3 business for statutory damages on an individual or classwide basis, a consumer provides a
4 business 30 days' written notice identifying the specific provisions of this chapter the
5 consumer alleges have been or are being violated. In the event a cure is possible, if within
6 the 30 days the business actually cures the noticed violation and provides the consumer an
7 express written statement that the violations have been cured and that no further violations
8 will occur, no action for individual statutory damages or classwide statutory damages may
9 be initiated against the business. Notice is not required prior to an individual consumer's
10 initiating an action solely for actual pecuniary damages suffered as a result of the alleged
11 violation of this chapter. If a business continues to violate this chapter in breach of the
12 express written statement provided to the consumer under this section, the consumer may
13 initiate an action against the business to enforce the written statement and may pursue
14 statutory damages for each breach of the express written statement, as well as any other
15 violation of the chapter that postdates the written statement.
16 3. Defined violations; no basis for private right of action under other law. The
17 cause of action established by this section applies only to violations as defined in subsection
18 1 and may not be based on violations of any other section of this chapter. Nothing in this
19 chapter may be interpreted to serve as the basis for a private right of action under any other
20 law. This section may not be construed to relieve any party from any duties or obligations
21 imposed under other law or the United States Constitution or the Constitution of Maine.
22 ยง9615. Compliance; civil penalties
23 1. Guidance of Attorney General. Any business or 3rd party may seek the opinion
24 of the Attorney General for guidance on how to comply with the provisions of this chapter.
25 2. Failure to cure; civil penalties. A business violates this chapter if it fails to cure
26 any alleged violation within 30 days after being notified of alleged noncompliance. A
27 business, service provider or other person that violates this chapter is subject to an
28 injunction and liable for a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each violation or $7,500
29 for each intentional violation, which must be assessed and recovered in a civil action
30 brought in the name of the State by the Attorney General. The civil penalties provided for
31 in this section must be exclusively assessed and recovered in a civil action brought in the
32 name of the State by the Attorney General.
33 3. Consumer Privacy Fund. Any civil penalty assessed for a violation of this chapter
34 and the proceeds of any settlement of an action brought pursuant to subsection 2 must be
35 deposited in the Consumer Privacy Fund created pursuant to section 9616, subsection 1.
36 ยง9616. Consumer Privacy Fund
37 1. Consumer Privacy Fund created. A special fund to be known and referred to in
38 this section as "the Consumer Privacy Fund" is created within the General Fund in the State
39 Treasury. The purpose of the fund is to offset any costs incurred by the courts in connection
40 with actions brought to enforce this chapter and any costs incurred by the Attorney General
41 in carrying out the Attorney General's duties under this chapter.
42 2. Uses. Funds transferred to the Consumer Privacy Fund must be used exclusively to
43 offset any costs incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with
44 this chapter. These funds may not be subject to appropriation or transfer by the Legislature 
Page 22 - 130LR2336(01)
45 for any other purpose, unless the Commissioner of Administrative and Financial Services
46 determines that the funds are in excess of the funding needed to fully offset the costs
47 incurred by the state courts and the Attorney General in connection with this chapter, in
48 which case the Legislature may appropriate excess funds for other purposes.
5 ยง9617. Privacy protection
6 This chapter is intended to further the right of privacy and to supplement existing laws
7 relating to consumers' personal information. The provisions of this chapter are not limited
8 to information collected electronically or over the Internet, but apply to the collection and
9 sale of all personal information collected by a business from consumers. Wherever
10 possible, law relating to consumers' personal information must be construed to harmonize
11 with the provisions of this chapter, but in the event of a conflict between other laws and the
12 provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the law that afford the greatest protection for
13 the right of privacy for consumers control.
14 ยง9618. Preemption
15 This chapter is a matter of statewide concern and supersedes and preempts all rules,
16 regulations, codes, ordinances and other laws adopted by a municipality, county or local
17 agency regarding the collection and sale of consumers' personal information by a business.
18 ยง9619. Rules
19 1. Rules. On or before January 1, 2023, the Attorney General shall solicit broad public
20 participation and adopt rules to further the purposes of this chapter, including, but not
21 limited to, the following areas:

23 enumerated in section 9602, subsection 13 in order to address changes in technology,
24 data collection practices, obstacles to implementation and privacy concerns;
25 B. Updating as needed the definition of "unique identifiers" to address changes in
26 technology, data collection, obstacles to implementation and privacy concerns, and to

29 9609;

34 (1) To facilitate and govern the submission of a request by a consumer to opt out
35 of the sale of personal information pursuant to section 9607;
36 (2) To govern business compliance with a consumer's opt out request; and
37 (3) For the development and use of a recognizable and uniform opt out logo or
38 button by all businesses to promote consumer awareness of the opportunity to opt
39 out of the sale of personal information;
40 E. Adjusting the monetary threshold in section 9602, subsection 3, paragraph A,
41 subparagraph (1) in January of every odd-numbered year to reflect any increase in the

Page 23 - 130LR2336(01)
1 F. Establishing rules, procedures and any exceptions necessary to ensure that the
2 notices and information that businesses are required to provide pursuant to this chapter
3 are provided in a manner that may be easily understood by the average consumer, are
4 accessible to consumers with disabilities and are available in the language primarily
5 used to interact with the consumer, including establishing rules and guidelines
6 regarding financial incentive offerings, within one year of passage of this chapter and
7 as needed thereafter; and
8 G. Establishing rules and procedures to further the purposes of sections 9605 and 9606
9 and to facilitate a consumer's or the consumer's authorized agent's ability to obtain
10 information pursuant to section 9609, with the goal of minimizing the administrative
11 burden on consumers, taking into account available technology, security concerns and
12 the burden on the business, to govern a business's determination that a request for
13 information received from a consumer is a verifiable consumer request, including
14 treating a request submitted through a password-protected account maintained by the
15 consumer with the business while the consumer is logged into the account as a
16 verifiable consumer request and providing a mechanism for a consumer who does not
17 maintain an account with the business to request information through the business's
18 authentication of the consumer's identity, within one year of passage of this chapter
19 and as needed thereafter.
20 2. Additional rules. The Attorney General may adopt additional rules as follows:
21 A. To establish rules and procedures on how to process and comply with verifiable
22 consumer requests for specific pieces of personal information relating to a household
23 in order to address obstacles to implementation and privacy concerns; and
24 B. As necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
25 3. Time of enforcement action. The Attorney General may not bring an enforcement
26 action under this chapter until 6 months after the adoption of the final rules issued pursuant
27 to this section or July 1, 2023, whichever is sooner.
28 4. Routine technical rules. Rules adopted under this section are routine technical
29 rules pursuant to Title 5, chapter 375, subchapter 2-A.
30 ยง9620. Series of steps or transactions
31 If a series of steps or transactions were component parts of a single transaction intended
32 from the beginning to be taken with the intention of avoiding the reach of this chapter,
33 including the disclosure of information by a business to a 3rd party in order to avoid the
34 definition of "sell," a court shall disregard the intermediate steps or transactions for
35 purposes of effectuating the purposes of this chapter.
36 ยง9621. Waiver or limit of rights void and unenforceable
37 Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or limit in
38 any way a consumer's rights under this chapter, including, but not limited to, any right to a
39 remedy or means of enforcement, is deemed contrary to public policy and is void and
40 unenforceable. This section does not prevent a consumer from declining to request
41 information from a business, declining to opt out of a business's sale of the consumer's
42 personal information or authorizing a business to sell the consumer's personal information
43 after previously opting out.

17 or charge than is permitted by this Article through any method. A loan made in violation
18 of this Part is void and uncollectible as to any principal, fee, interest or charge.

21 SUMMARY
22 Part A of this bill establishes the Maine Consumer Privacy Act. It applies to the
23 collection and sale of all personal information collected by a business from consumers.
24 Because the new Act covers Internet service providers, this bill repeals the Maine Revised
25 Statutes, Title 35-A, chapter 94 to keep all entities on equal footing, allowing consumers
26 to opt out of the sale of personal information.
27 The Maine Consumer Privacy Act takes effect January 1, 2023. The repeal of Title
28 35-A, chapter 94 is effective January 1, 2023.
29 Part B of this bill establishes the Maine Small Dollar Consumer Protection Act. It
30 outlines the process for supervised lenders to offer small dollar loans, which are defined as
31 loans not exceeding $2,500, and the rights that consumers have when entering into small
32 dollar loan agreements.
