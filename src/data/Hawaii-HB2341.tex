(a)  A consumer may invoke the consumer rights specified in this subsection at any time by submitting a request to a controller specifying the consumer rights the consumer wishes to invoke.  A child's parent or legal guardian may invoke the same consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding processing personal data belonging to the child.  A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the right:

     (1)  To confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's personal data and to access the personal data;

     (2)  To correct inaccuracies in the consumer's personal data, taking into account the nature of the personal data and the purposes of the processing of the consumer's personal data;

     (3)  To delete personal data provided by or obtained about the consumer;

          (B)  The sale of personal data; or

          (C)  Profiling in furtherance of decisions made by the controller that results in the provision or denial by the controller of financial and lending services, housing, insurance, education enrollment, criminal justice, employment opportunities, health care services, or access to basic necessities, including food and water.

     (b)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise the consumer rights specified in subsection (a) as follows:

     (1)  A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all cases within forty-five days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to the methods described in subsection (a).  The response period may be extended once by forty-five additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, so long as the controller informs the consumer of the extension within the initial forty-five-day response period, together with the reason for the extension;

     (2)  If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the controller, without undue delay, but no later than forty-five days of receipt of the request, shall inform the consumer in writing of the justification for declining to take action and instructions for appealing the decision pursuant to subsection (c);

     (3)  Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided by a controller free of charge, up to twice annually per consumer.  If requests from a consumer are manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive, the controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the request.  The controller shall bear the burden of demonstrating the manifestly unfounded, excessive, or repetitive nature of the request; and

     (4)  If a controller is unable to authenticate the request using commercially reasonable efforts, the controller shall not be required to comply with a request to initiate an action under subsection (a) and may request that the consumer provide additional information reasonably necessary to authenticate the consumer and the consumer's request.

     (c)  A controller shall establish a process for a consumer to appeal the controller's refusal to take action on a request within a reasonable period of time after the consumer's receipt of the decision pursuant to subsection (b)(2); provided that the appeal process shall be similar to the process for submitting requests to initiate action pursuant to subsection (a).  Within sixty days of receipt of an appeal, a controller shall inform the consumer in writing of its decision, including a written explanation of the reasons for the decision.  If the appeal is denied, the controller shall also provide the consumer with an online method, if available, or other method through which the consumer may contact the department to submit a complaint.

     ยง   -4  Data controller responsibilities; transparency.  (a)  A controller shall:

     (1)  Limit the collection of personal data to data that is adequate, relevant, and reasonably necessary in relation to the purposes for which the data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer;

     (2)  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, not process personal data for purposes that are neither reasonably necessary to nor compatible with the disclosed purposes for which the personal data is processed, as disclosed to the consumer, unless the controller obtains the consumer's consent;

     (3)  Establish, implement, and maintain reasonable administrative, technical, and physical data security practices to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and accessibility of personal data.

     (1)  The categories of personal data processed by the controller;

     (2)  The purpose for processing personal data;

     (4)  The categories of personal data that the controller shares with third parties, if any; and

     (5)  The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the controller shares personal data.

     (d)  If a controller sells personal data to third parties or processes personal data for targeted advertising, the controller shall clearly and conspicuously disclose the processing, as well as the manner in which a consumer may exercise the right to opt out of the processing.

     (e)  A controller shall establish, and shall describe in a privacy notice, one or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to exercise their consumer rights under this chapter.  Those means shall take into account the ways in which consumers normally interact with the controller, the need for secure and reliable communication of the requests, and the ability of the controller to authenticate the identity of the consumer making the request.  Controllers shall not require a consumer to create a new account in order to exercise consumer rights pursuant to section    -3 but may require a consumer to use an existing account.

     (f)  A controller shall not discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights contained in this chapter, including denying goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer; provided that nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller to provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer that the controller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if the consumer has exercised the consumer's right to opt out pursuant to section    -3 or the offer is related to a consumer's voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program.

     ยง   -5  Responsibility according to role; controller and processor.  (a)  In meeting its obligations under this chapter, a processor shall adhere to the instructions of a controller and shall assist the controller.  The assistance shall include:

     (1)  Consideration of the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures, insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation to respond to consumer rights requests pursuant to section    -3;

     (2)  Consideration of account the nature of processing and the information available to the processor, by assisting the controller in meeting the controller's obligations in relation to the security of processing the personal data and in relation to the notice of security breach pursuant to section 487N-2 in order to meet the controller's obligations; and

     (3)  The provision of necessary information to enable the controller to conduct and document data protection assessments pursuant to section    -6.

     (b)  A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the controller.  The contract shall be binding and clearly set forth instructions for processing data, the nature and purpose of processing, the type of data subject to processing, the duration of processing, and the rights and obligations of both parties.  The contract shall also include requirements that the processor shall:

     (1)  Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of confidentiality with respect to the data;

     (2)  At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the controller as requested at the end of the provision of services, unless retention of the personal data is required by law;

     (3)  Upon the reasonable request of the controller, make available to the controller all information in its possession necessary to demonstrate the processor's compliance with the obligations in this chapter;

     (4)  Allow, and cooperate with, reasonable assessments by the controller or the controller's designated assessor; alternatively, the processor may arrange for a qualified and independent assessor to conduct an assessment of the processor's policies and technical and organizational measures in support of the obligations under this chapter using an appropriate and accepted control standard or framework and assessment procedure for the assessments.  The processor shall provide a report of the assessment to the controller upon request; and

     (5)  Engage any subcontractor pursuant to a written contract in accordance with subsection (c) that requires the subcontractor to meet the obligations of the processor with respect to the personal data.

     (c)  Nothing in this section shall be construed to relieve a controller or a processor from the liabilities imposed on the controller or processor by virtue of the controller's or processor's role in the processing relationship as defined by this chapter.

     (d)  A determination regarding whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon the context in which personal data is to be processed.  A processor that continues to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of personal data remains a processor.

     ยง   -6  Data protection assessments.  (a)  The data protection assessment requirements of this section shall apply to processing activities created or generated after January 1, 2024.

     (b)  A controller shall conduct and document a data protection assessment of each of the following processing activities involving personal data:

     (1)  The processing of personal data for purposes of targeted advertising;

     (2)  The sale of personal data;

     (3)  The processing of personal data for purposes of profiling, where the profiling presents a reasonably foreseeable risk of:

          (A)  Unfair or deceptive treatment of, or unlawful disparate impact on, consumers;

          (B)  Financial, physical, or reputational injury to consumers;

          (C)  A physical intrusion or other intrusion upon the solitude or seclusion, or the private affairs or concerns, of consumers, where the intrusion would be offensive to a reasonable person; or

          (D)  Other substantial injury to consumers;

     (4)  The processing of sensitive data; and

     (5)  Any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers.

     (c)  Data protection assessments conducted pursuant to subsection (b) shall identify and evaluate the benefits, direct or indirect, that a controller, consumer, other stakeholders, and the public may derive from processing against the potential risks to the rights of consumers associated with the processing, as mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the controller to reduce the risks.  The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of consumers, as well as the context of the processing and the relationship between the controller and the consumer whose personal data is processed, shall be factored into this assessment by the controller.

     (d)  The department may request, pursuant to a civil investigative demand, that a controller disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an investigation conducted by the department, and the controller shall make the data protection assessment available to the department.  The department may evaluate the data protection assessment for compliance with the responsibilities set forth in section    -4.  Data protection assessments shall be confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under chapter 92F.  The disclosure of a data protection assessment pursuant to a request from the department shall not constitute a waiver of attorney-client privilege or work product protection with respect to the assessment and any information contained in the assessment.

     (e)  A single data protection assessment may address a comparable set of processing operations that include similar activities.

     (f)  Data protection assessments conducted by a controller for the purpose of compliance with other laws may comply under this section if the assessments have a reasonably comparable scope and effect.

     (1)  Re-identify de-identified data or pseudonymous data; or

     (2)  Maintain data in identifiable form, or collect, obtain, retain, or access any data or technology, in order to be capable of associating an authenticated consumer request with personal data.

     (c)  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to require a controller or processor to comply with an authenticated consumer rights request pursuant to section    -3 if all of the following are true:

     (1)  The controller is not reasonably capable of associating the request with the personal data or it would be unreasonably burdensome for the controller to associate the request with the personal data;

     (2)  The controller does not use the personal data to recognize or respond to the specific consumer who is the subject of the personal data, or associate the personal data with other personal data about the same specific consumer; and

     (3)  The controller does not sell the personal data to any third party or otherwise voluntarily disclose the personal data to any third party other than a processor, except as otherwise permitted in this section.

     (d)  The consumer rights specified in section    -3(a)(1) to (4) and section    -4 shall not apply to pseudonymous data in cases in which the controller is able to demonstrate that any additional information necessary to identify the consumer is kept separately and is subject to effective technical and organizational controls that:

     (1)  Ensure that the personal data is not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person; and

     (2)  Prevent the controller from accessing the information.

     (e)  A controller that discloses pseudonymous data or deโidentified data shall exercise reasonable oversight to monitor compliance with any contractual commitments to which the pseudonymous data or de-identified data is subject and shall take appropriate steps to address any breaches of those contractual commitments.

     (c)  The obligations imposed on controllers or processors under this chapter shall not apply where compliance by the controller or processor with this chapter would violate an evidentiary privilege under state law.
