1 AN ACT Relating to establishing data privacy protections to
2 strengthen a consumer's ability to access, manage, and protect their
3 personal data; adding a new section to chapter 42.56 RCW; adding new
4 chapters to Title 19 RCW; creating a new section; prescribing
penalties; and providing an effective date.5
6 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:
7 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS AND INTENT. (1) The
8 legislature finds that the people of Washington regard their privacy
9 as a fundamental right and an essential element of their individual
10 freedom. Washington's Constitution explicitly provides the right to
11 privacy and fundamental privacy rights have long been and continue to
12 be integral to protecting Washingtonians and to safeguarding our
13 democratic republic.
14 (2) Washington is a technology leader on a national and global
15 level and recognizes its distinctive position in promoting the
16 efficient balance of consumer privacy and economic benefits. Ongoing
17 advances in technology have produced an exponential growth in the
18 volume and variety of personal data being generated, collected,
19 stored, and analyzed, which presents both promise and potential
20 peril. The ability to harness and use data in positive ways is
21 driving innovation and brings beneficial technologies to society.

SENATE BILL 5813
State of Washington 67th Legislature 2022 Regular Session
By Senators Carlyle and Nguyen
p. 1 SB 5813
1 However, it has also created risks to privacy and freedom. The
2 unregulated and unauthorized use and disclosure of personal
3 information and loss of privacy can have devastating impacts, ranging
4 from financial fraud, identity theft, and unnecessary costs, to
5 personal time and finances, to destruction of property, harassment,
6 reputational damage, emotional distress, and physical harm.
7 (3) From a very young age, today's youth spend an extensive
8 amount of their time engaged in online activities and services for
9 various purposes including education, socializing, shopping, gaming,
10 and entertainment. Children and adolescents navigate various websites
11 and online applications without fully understanding what personal
12 data is being collected about them, how this data can impact them in
13 the future, or how to ensure the privacy and security of their
14 personal data. The personal data of this vulnerable population
15 requires and deserves additional protections, which includes parental
16 or guardian oversight, adolescent control of data, and the ability
17 for adults to delete their personal data from when they were a child
or adolescent.18
19 (4) There are many different types of businesses that collect
20 data about and from consumers. However, a data broker is in the
21 business of combining and selling data about consumers with whom it
22 does not have a direct relationship. Data brokers often collect data
23 from multiple sources, all while consumers may not know that the data
24 broker exists. While data brokers offer many benefits in a modern
25 economy, such as providing information that is critical to services
26 including credit reporting, background checks, risk mitigation, fraud
27 detection, and people search, there are also risks associated with
28 the prevalent combination and sale of data about consumers. These
29 risks may relate to a consumer's ability to know and control
30 information held and sold about them and risks due to the
31 unauthorized or harmful acquisition and use of consumer information.
32 (5) In order to provide consumers with more control over how
33 their personal data is used by businesses, several states have
34 enacted laws that provide consumers with the right to opt out of
35 targeted advertising and the sale of their data. In an effort to make
36 the opt out right more workable for consumers, such laws often
37 authorize consumers to request to opt out through do not track
38 mechanisms and require businesses to recognize these requests.
39 However, technical specifications needed to implement such a
p. 2 SB 5813
1 requirement are in the early stages of development and it is worth
taking a measured, thoughtful approach.2
3 (6) With this act, the legislature intends to: Strengthen and
4 expand existing privacy protections for Washington residents by
5 establishing additional protections and controls for the personal
6 data of children and adolescents; provide consumers transparency
7 about data brokers; require data brokers to allow consumers to
8 access, delete, and correct their data; and engage in deliberate,
9 inclusive rule making to determine appropriate and reasonable
10 technical specifications for honoring consumer requests to opt out of
11 certain processing. In addition, this act imposes affirmative
12 obligations upon companies to safeguard personal data and provide
13 clear, understandable, and transparent information to consumers about
how their personal data is used.14

4 personal data of a child in compliance with the children's online
5 privacy protection act, Title 15 U.S.C. Secs. 6501 through 6506 and

request, together with the reasons for the delay.18
19 (4) Businesses may not charge a fee for responding to requests to
20 exercise the rights in sections 103 through 105 of this act unless

22 excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, in
23 which case the business may either: (a) Charge a reasonable fee to
24 cover the administrative costs of complying with the request; or (b)
25 refuse to act on the request. The business bears the burden of
26 demonstrating the manifestly unfounded or excessive character of the

36 or legal guardian, an adolescent, or an adult under this chapter is
37 deemed contrary to public policy and is void and unenforceable.
38 NEW SECTION. Sec. 107. (1) A business may not process the
39 personal data of a known adolescent or a known child in any way that:
p. 10 SB 5813
1 (i) Unfairly disadvantages the adolescent or the child considering
2 the benefits of the processing, the risk of harm to the adolescent or
3 the child, and the ability of the business to avoid any potential

5 reasonably foreseeable harm to a known adolescent or known child; or
6 (iii) would be unexpected and highly offensive to a reasonable
person.7

may be exercised;16
17 (d) The categories of personal data pertaining to children or
18 adolescents that the business shares with third parties, if any; and
19 (e) The categories of third parties, if any, with whom the

volume and nature of the personal data at issue.26
27 (4) A business's collection of a child's or adolescent's personal
28 data must be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is reasonably
29 necessary in relation to the purposes for which data is processed.
30 (5) Except as provided in this chapter, a business may not
31 process the personal data of a child or an adolescent for purposes
32 that are not reasonably necessary to, or compatible with, the
33 specified purposes for which the personal data is processed unless
34 the business obtains the necessary consents as described in section
102 of this act.35
36 (6) A business may not retain personal data of a child or
37 adolescent for longer than is necessary to fulfill a transaction or
38 provide a service requested by the child or adolescent or such other
39 purposes as permitted by this chapter. The business must implement a
p. 11 SB 5813
1 reasonable and appropriate data disposal policy based on the nature
and sensitivity of the personal data.2
3 (7) The personal data of a child or adolescent may not be used to
4 direct content to the child or adolescent, or a group of individuals
5 similar to the child or adolescent, on the basis of race,

13 with the ability of adolescents, children, parents, or lawful
14 guardians to understand a term or condition of a product or service
15 involving the processing of personal data; or (b) unreasonably take
16 advantage of or unreasonably fail to account for or remedy: (i) A
17 lack of understanding by an adolescent, a child, or a parent or
18 lawful guardian of the material risks, costs, or conditions of a
19 product or service involving the processing of personal data; (ii)
20 the inability of an adolescent, a child, or a parent or lawful
21 guardian to protect the interests of the adolescent, child, or parent
22 or lawful guardian in selecting or using a product or service
23 involving the processing of personal data; or (iii) the reasonable
24 reliance by an adolescent, a child, or a parent or lawful guardian on
25 a business to act in the best interests of the adolescent or child.
26 (10) A business may not discriminate against a child, a parent or
27 legal guardian of a child, an adolescent, or an adult for exercising
28 any of the rights contained in this chapter, including denying them
29 goods or services, charging different prices or rates for goods or
30 services, and providing a different level of quality of goods and
31 services. This subsection does not prohibit a business from offering
32 a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or
33 services to a parent or legal guardian of a child or an adolescent,
34 including offering goods or services for no fee, if: (a) The offering
35 is in connection with voluntary participation in a bona fide loyalty,
36 rewards, premium features, discounts, or club card program; (b) the
37 use and any dissemination of personal data as part of the program is
38 clearly and conspicuously disclosed, separate and apart from any
39 other terms applicable to the program, to the parent or legal
40 guardian of a child or the adolescent; (c) the parent or legal
p. 12 SB 5813
1 guardian of a child or the adolescent provides consent to such use
2 and disclosures; and (d) any third party who receives personal data
3 as part of the program uses the personal data only for purposes of
4 facilitating the benefits to which the parent or legal guardian of a
5 child or the adolescent is entitled and does not retain or otherwise
6 use or disclose the personal data for any other purpose.
7 NEW SECTION. Sec. 108. (1) A business must conduct and document
8 a data protection assessment of each of its processing activities
9 involving the personal data of children or adolescents. Such a data
10 protection assessment must take into account the type of personal
11 data to be processed by the business, including the extent to which
12 the personal data is sensitive data, and the context in which the
13 personal data is to be processed.
14 (2) A data protection assessment conducted under subsection (1)
15 of this section must identify and weigh the benefits that may flow
16 directly and indirectly from the processing to the business, the
17 adolescent or child, other stakeholders, and the public against the
18 potential risks to the rights of the adolescent, child, or parent or
19 legal guardian of the child associated with such processing, as
20 mitigated by safeguards that can be employed by the business to
21 reduce such risks. The use of deidentified data and the reasonable
22 expectations of adolescents, children, and parents or legal
23 guardians, as well as the context of the processing and the
24 relationship between the business and the adolescent, child, or
25 parent or legal guardian must be factored into this assessment by the
business.26
27 (3) The attorney general may request, in writing, that a business
28 disclose any data protection assessment that is relevant to an
29 investigation conducted by the attorney general. The business must
30 make a data protection assessment available to the attorney general
31 upon such a request. The attorney general may evaluate the data
32 protection assessments for compliance with the responsibilities
33 contained in this chapter and, if it serves a civil investigative
34 demand, with RCW 19.86.110. Data protection assessments are
35 confidential and exempt from public inspection and copying under
36 chapter 42.56 RCW. The disclosure of a data protection assessment
37 pursuant to a request from the attorney general under this subsection
