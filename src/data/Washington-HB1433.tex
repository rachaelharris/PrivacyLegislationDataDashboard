1 AN ACT Relating to creating a charter of people's personal data
2 rights; adding a new chapter to Title 19 RCW; and prescribing
penalties.3
4 BE IT ENACTED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF WASHINGTON:
5 NEW SECTION. Sec. 1. This act may be known and cited as the
6 people's privacy act.
7 NEW SECTION. Sec. 2. The legislature finds that:
8 (1) Washingtonians have an explicit right to privacy under
9 Article I, section 7 of the Washington state Constitution and this
10 act furthers protection of that fundamental constitutional right.
11 (2) Advances in technology and the rapid growth in the volume and
12 variety of personal information being generated, collected, stored,
13 and analyzed have increased harms to individual and collective
14 privacy, making the protection of this vital right a matter of
urgency.15
16 (3) Privacy violations and misuse of personal information in the
17 digital age can lead to a range of harms, including discrimination in
18 employment, health care, housing, access to credit, and other areas;
19 unfair price discrimination; domestic violence; abuse; stalking;
H-0518.1
HOUSE BILL 1433
State of Washington 67th Legislature 2021 Regular Session
By Representative Kloba
p. 1 HB 1433
1 harassment; entrapment; and financial, emotional, and reputational
harms.2
3 (4) Privacy harms disproportionately affect low-income people and
people of color.4
5 (5) Privacy violations not only threaten the fundamental rights
6 and privileges of Washingtonians, but they also menace the foundation
7 and supporting institutions of a free democratic state.
8 (6) Washingtonians are increasingly required to share personal
9 information and are subjected to automated forms of surveillance and
10 classification as a consequence of simply participating in public
11 life and accessing basic social goods, services, and opportunities.
12 (7) Entities that collect, use, retain, share, and monetize
13 personal information have specialized knowledge about the algorithms
14 and data security measures they use, as well as information about how
15 they collect, use, retain, share, and monetize personal information
16 that the average individual is unlikely to understand. Just as banks,
17 lawyers, and medical providers, given their specialized knowledge,
18 have special obligations to individuals, entities collecting intimate
19 personal information in the digital age and benefiting from similarly
20 specialized knowledge should have similar obligations.
21 (8) Privacy is the foundation of consumer trust, particularly in
22 electronic commerce, and people will use advanced data-driven
23 technology only if their privacy rights are respected, their personal
24 information is safeguarded, and their freedom to choose how much
personal information to share is unobstructed.25
26 (9) The state of Washington is more protective of personal
27 privacy than many other states and has an obligation to ensure that
28 its residents can control their personal information and are able to
29 understand and regulate how that personal information may be used by
others.30
31 (10) Requiring entities to obtain opt-in consent prior to the use
32 or disclosure of personal information is essential to protecting
33 personal privacy. Without opt-in consent, individuals who wish to
34 control their personal information face an insurmountable challenge
35 of identifying and engaging with each and every entity they
36 encounter, while businesses lack the incentive to present individuals
37 with meaningful opportunities to choose. An opt-in approach gives
38 people meaningful control over their personal information while
39 allowing businesses to choose how and whether they request consent to
process that information.40

15 (h) A covered entity shall not discriminate against individuals
16 by reason of their not granting opt-in consent to the processing of

purpose of operating such program.31
32 (i) A covered entity shall not state or imply that the quality of
33 a product or service will be diminished and shall not actually
34 diminish the quality of a product or service if the individual
35 declines to give opt-in consent to captured personal information
processing.36
37 (j) The Washington state department of commerce is hereby
38 authorized and directed to conduct a study to determine the most
39 effective way for covered entities to obtain individuals' freely
p. 11 HB 1433
1 given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in consent for each
type of captured personal information processing.2
3 (k) The Washington state department of commerce may request data

33 with the office of privacy and data protection, may develop
34 appropriate security standards for captured personal information.
35 This subsection preempts (a) of this subsection only to the extent
36 that security standards developed are more protective of captured
37 personal information than is the industry standard of care.
(4) Access to personal information.38
39 (a) A covered entity that processes an individual's captured
40 personal information must provide the individual with a reasonable
p. 12 HB 1433
1 means to access their personal information processed by such entity,

obtained captured personal information; and6
7 (iii) The types of third parties to which the covered entity has
8 disclosed or will disclose captured personal information.

18 chapter, a covered entity or governmental entity may list personal
19 information such as name or birthdate and biometric information such
20 as height, weight, or photograph on an issued license, membership or

22 other representative of the covered entity to determine based solely
23 on personal observation, and without the assistance of technologies
24 such as facial recognition, whether the person physically holding
25 such license or card is the person entitled to hold it, provided
26 further that such intended use is disclosed to the individual prior
27 to capturing the biometric information. Any other processing of such
28 biometric information shall be subject to all the terms and
29 conditions of this chapter. Any covered entity or governmental entity

p. 18 HB 1433
1 finance, health care, credit, insurance, housing, or education

4 class of individuals' actual, perceived, or proxies for actual or
5 perceived age, race, creed, color, national origin, sexual
6 orientation, gender identity or expression, sex, disability,
7 predisposing genetic characteristics, or domestic violence victim
status, except as specifically authorized by law;8
9 (b) For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to

14 an individual's or class of individuals' actual, perceived, or
15 proxies for actual or perceived age, race, creed, color, national
16 origin, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, sex,
17 disability, predisposing genetic characteristics, or domestic
18 violence victim status, except as specifically authorized by law;

35 individual is identified or attempted to be identified based on the
36 characteristics of the individual's face; or (ii) an automated or
37 semiautomated process by which the characteristics of an individual's
38 face are analyzed to determine the individual's sentiment, state of
39 mind, or other propensities including, but not limited to, the
person's level of dangerousness;40
p. 19 HB 1433
1 (e) For a covered entity or Washington governmental entity to
2 operate, install, or commission the operation or installation of
3 equipment incorporating artificial intelligence-enabled profiling in
4 any place of public resort, accommodation, assemblage, or amusement,
5 as defined in RCW 49.60.040, or to use artificial intelligence6 enabled profiling to make decisions that produce legal effects or
7 similarly significant effects concerning individuals. Decisions that
8 include legal effects or similarly significant effects concerning
9 consumers include, without limitation, denial or degradation of
10 consequential services or support, such as financial or lending
11 services, housing, insurance, educational enrollment, criminal
12 justice, employment opportunities, health care services, and access
13 to basic necessities, such as food and water. For the purposes of
14 this subsection, "artificial intelligence-enabled profiling" means
15 the automated or semiautomated process by which the external or
16 internal characteristics of an individual are analyzed to determine,
17 infer, or characterize an individual's state of mind, character,
18 propensities, protected class status, political affiliation,

entity's compliance with this section.31
32 NEW SECTION. Sec. 9. (1) With respect to captured personal
33 information that is not biometric information, a covered entity shall
34 not be required to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and
35 unambiguous opt-in consent from an individual under section 5(2) of
36 this act if the processing is necessary to execute the specific
37 transaction for which the individual is providing captured personal
38 information, such as the provision of financial information to
39 complete a purchase or the provision of a mailing address to deliver
p. 20 HB 1433
1 a package. However, captured personal information shall not be
2 processed for any other purpose beyond that clear primary purpose
3 without the freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous opt-in
4 consent from the individual to whom the captured personal information
pertains, except as required by law.5
6 (2) With respect to captured personal information generally, a
7 covered entity or Washington governmental entity shall not be
8 required to obtain freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous
9 opt-in consent from an individual under section 5(2) or 7(1) of this
act if:10
11 (a) It believes that an emergency involving immediate danger of
12 death or serious physical injury to any individual requires obtaining
13 without delay captured personal information related to the emergency
14 and the request is narrowly tailored to address the emergency,
subject to the following limitations:15
16 (i) The request shall document the factual basis for believing
17 that an emergency involving immediate danger of death or serious
18 physical injury to an individual requires obtaining without delay

21 governmental entity obtaining captured personal information under
22 this subsection (a), the covered entity or Washington governmental
23 entity shall use reasonable efforts to inform the individual of the
24 captured personal information obtained; the details of the emergency;
25 and the reasons why the covered entity or Washington governmental
26 entity needed to use, access, or disclose the biometric information
27 and shall continue such efforts to inform until receipt of
information is confirmed; and28
29 (b) Disclosure is required to respond to a warrant or subpoena
30 issued by a court of competent jurisdiction or a subpoena issued by a
31 governmental entity or pursuant to a pending judicial proceeding:
32 (i) Unless a delayed notice is ordered, both the entity
33 requesting the warrant or subpoena and any entity receiving such
34 warrant or subpoena shall, simultaneous with requesting or receiving
35 a warrant compelling disclosure of or serving or receiving a subpoena
36 for captured personal information, serve or deliver the following
37 information to the subject of warrant or subpoena by registered or
38 first-class mail, email, or other means reasonably calculated to be

15 physical safety of an individual, flight from prosecution,
16 destruction of or tampering with evidence, intimidation of potential
17 witnesses, or otherwise seriously jeopardizing an investigation or
unduly delaying a trial.18
19 (iii) In the case of a subpoena, a covered entity subject to a
20 subpoena shall postpone compliance therewith until it has given the
21 subject of the subpoena notice of the information required under this
22 subsection (2)(b)(i) and has allowed at least 10 business days for
23 the subject to seek review of or otherwise challenge the subpoena;
24 (c) The disclosure is required by state or federal law;

29 collected, used, or stored exclusively for medical education or
30 research, public health or epidemiological purposes, health care
31 treatment, insurance, payment, or operations under the federal health

36 treat an illness or other medical condition or to further validate
scientific testing or screening.37
38 (4) To the extent the transaction requested by an individual is a
39 covered entity's placement of that individual's personal information
40 in the public domain, such as recording of a real estate deed showing
p. 22 HB 1433
1 name and address, the covered entity shall have the same rights as
2 any other person or entity with regard to such information.
3 (5) This chapter shall not apply to individuals sharing their
4 personal contact information such as email addresses with other
5 individuals in workplace, social, political or similar settings where
6 the purpose of the information is to facilitate communication among
7 such individuals, provided that any processing of such contact
8 information beyond interpersonal communication shall be covered by
9 this chapter. This chapter shall not apply to entities' publication
10 of entity-based member or employee contact information where such
11 publication is intended to allow members of the public to contact
12 such member or employee in the ordinary course of the entity's
operations.13
14 (6) Nothing in this chapter shall diminish any individual's or
15 entity's rights or obligations under chapter 70.02 RCW.
16 NEW SECTION. Sec. 10. (1) Private right of action.
17 (a) Any individual alleging a violation of this chapter or a
18 regulation adopted under this chapter may bring a civil action in any
19 court of competent jurisdiction. An individual protected by this
20 chapter may not be required, as a condition of service or otherwise,
21 to accept mandatory arbitration of a claim under this chapter.
22 (b) A violation of this chapter or a regulation adopted under
23 this chapter with respect to the captured personal information of an
24 individual constitute a rebuttable presumption of harm to that
individual.25
26 (c) In a civil action in which the plaintiff prevails, the court
may award:27
28 (i) Liquidated damages of $10,000 per violation or actual
damages, whichever is greater;29

costs to any prevailing plaintiff.35
36 (2)(a) The attorney general may bring an action in the name of
37 the state, or as parens patriae on behalf of persons residing in the
38 state, to enforce this chapter. For actions brought by the attorney
39 general to enforce this chapter, the legislature finds that the
p. 23 HB 1433
1 practices covered by this chapter are matters vitally affecting the
2 public interest for the purpose of applying the consumer protection
3 act, chapter 19.86 RCW. For actions brought by the attorney general
4 to enforce this section, a violation of this section is not
5 reasonable in relation to the development and preservation of
6 business and is an unfair or deceptive act in trade or commerce and
7 an unfair method of competition for purposes of applying the consumer
8 protection act, chapter 19.86 RCW. An action to enforce this section
may not be brought under RCW 19.86.090.9
10 (b) In an action brought by the attorney general, the court may
award:11
12 (i) Injunctive relief, including preliminary injunctions, to
13 prevent further violations of and compel compliance with this
chapter;14
15 (ii) Civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation or up to four
16 percent of annual revenue of the covered entity, data processer, or
third party, whichever is greater;17
18 (iii) Other appropriate relief, including restitution, to redress
19 harms to individuals or to mitigate all substantial risk of harm; and
20 (iv) Any other relief the court determines appropriate.
21 (3)(a) A city attorney or county prosecutor in a city or county
22 having a population in excess of 200,000, may bring an action to
23 enforce this chapter on behalf of the residents of such city or
county.24
25 (b) In an action brought by a district attorney or a city
attorney, the court may award:26
27 (i) Injunctive relief, including preliminary injunctions, to
28 prevent further violations of and compel compliance with this
chapter;29
30 (ii) Civil penalties of up to $25,000 per violation or up to four
31 percent of annual revenue of the covered entity, data processer, or
third party, whichever is greater;32
33 (iii) Other appropriate relief, including restitution, to redress
34 harms to individuals or to mitigate all substantial risk of harm; and
35 (iv) Any other relief the court determines appropriate.
36 (4) When calculating damages and civil penalties, the court shall
37 consider the number of affected individuals, the severity of the
38 violation, and the precautions taken to prevent a violation.
39 (5) Each individual whose captured personal information was
40 unlawfully processed, each instance of processing counts as a
p. 24 HB 1433
1 separate violation. Each provision of this chapter that was violated
counts as a separate violation.2
3 (6) It is a violation of this chapter for a covered entity,
4 Washington governmental entity, or anyone else acting on behalf of a
5 covered entity or Washington governmental entity to retaliate against
6 an individual who makes a good-faith complaint that there has been a
7 failure to comply with any part of this chapter. An individual who is
8 injured by a violation of this subsection (6) may bring a civil
9 action for monetary damages and injunctive relief in any court of
competent jurisdiction.10
11 (7) If a series of steps or transactions with regard to a set of
12 personal information are undertaken with the intention of avoiding
13 the intent of this chapter, a court shall disregard the intermediate
14 steps or transactions for purposes of effectuating the purposes of
this chapter.15
16 (8) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind,
17 including a covered entity's terms of service or a privacy policy,
18 including the short-form privacy notice required under section 5(1)
19 of this act, that purports to waive or limit in any way an
20 individual's rights under this chapter, including, but not limited
21 to, any right to a remedy or means of enforcement, shall be deemed
22 contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.
23 (9) For purposes of causes of action based on violations of this
24 chapter, the statute of limitations period shall commence only upon
25 discovery of the violation of this chapter or of the injury caused by
such a violation, whichever occurs later.26
27 (10) A covered entity that is a provider of an interactive
28 computer service, as defined in 47 U.S.C. Sec. 230, may not be
29 treated as the publisher or speaker of any personal information
30 provided by another information content provider, as defined in 47
31 U.S.C. Sec. 230. Allowing the posting of information by a user
32 without other action by the interactive computer service is not
33 considered processing of the personal information by the interactive
computer service.34
35 (11) No private or government action brought pursuant to this
36 chapter shall preclude any other action under this chapter.
37 NEW SECTION. Sec. 11. (1) This chapter shall not supersede
38 local or state laws, regulations, or ordinances except to the extent
39 that it provides stronger privacy protections for individuals.
p. 25 HB 1433
1 (2) Subject to subsection (3) of this section, covered entities
2 that are subject to federal laws concerning the processing of
3 individuals' captured personal information are covered by this
4 chapter to the extent that it provides stronger privacy protections
5 for individuals than those federal laws and that those federal laws
do not preempt state laws.6
7 (3) This chapter shall not override any valid law or regulation
8 explicitly compelling disclosure of or giving access to captured
9 personal information such as in chapter 42.17A RCW.
10 NEW SECTION. Sec. 12. If any provision of this act or its
11 application to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the
12 remainder of the act or the application of the provision to other
13 persons or circumstances is not affected.
14 NEW SECTION. Sec. 13. Sections 1 through 11 of this act
15 constitute a new chapter in Title 19 RCW.
