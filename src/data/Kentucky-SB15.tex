UNOFFICIAL COPY 22 RS BR 158
Page 12 of 32
XXXX Jacketed
1 at any time by submitting a request to a controller, via the means specified by the
2 controller pursuant to Section 4 of this Act, specifying the consumer rights the
3 consumer wishes to invoke. A child's parent or legal guardian may invoke such
4 consumer rights on behalf of the child regarding processing personal data
5 belonging to the child.
6 (2) A controller shall comply with an authenticated consumer request to exercise the
7 right:
8 (a) To confirm whether or not a controller is processing the consumer's
9 personal data and to access such personal data;
10 (b) To delete personal data provided by the consumer;
11 (c) To obtain a copy of the consumer's personal data that the consumer
12 previously provided to the controller in a portable and, to the extent
13 technically practicable, readily usable format that allows the consumer to
14 read or transmit the data to another controller without hindrance, where
15 the processing is carried out by automated means;
16 (d) To opt out of targeted advertising;
17 (e) To opt out of tracking; and
18 (f) To opt out of the sale or sharing of personal data.
19 (3) Except as otherwise provided in Subsection (4) of this section and Sections 6 and
20 7 of this Act, a controller shall comply with a request by a consumer to exercise
21 the consumer rights pursuant to this section as follows:
22 (a) A controller shall respond to the consumer without undue delay, but in all
23 cases within thirty (30) days of receipt of the request submitted pursuant to
24 the methods described in this section. The response period may be extended
25 once by fifteen (15) additional days when reasonably necessary, taking into
26 account the complexity and number of the consumer's requests, so long as
27 the controller informs the consumer of any such extension within the initial 
UNOFFICIAL COPY 22 RS BR 158
Page 13 of 32
XXXX Jacketed
1 thirty (30) day response period, together with the reason for the extension;
2 (b) If a controller declines to take action regarding the consumer's request, the

5 justification for declining to take action; and
6 (c) Information provided in response to a consumer request shall be provided
7 by a controller free of charge, at least twice annually per consumer. If
8 requests from a consumer are excessive, repetitive, technically infeasible, or
9 manifestly unfounded, such as when the controller reasonably believes that
10 the primary purpose of the requests is not to exercise a consumer right, the
11 controller may charge the consumer a reasonable fee to cover the
12 administrative costs of complying with the request or decline to act on the
13 request. The controller bears the burden of demonstrating the excessive,
14 repetitive, technically infeasible, or manifestly unfounded nature of the
15 request.
16 (4) A controller shall not be required to comply with a request to exercise any of the
17 rights set forth in this section if the controller is unable to authenticate the
18 request using commercially reasonable efforts. In such a case, the controller
19 may, but is not required to, request the provision of additional information
20 reasonably necessary to authenticate the request.
21 (5) A controller shall:
22 (a) Establish an internal process whereby a consumer may appeal a refusal to
23 take action on a request to exercise any of the rights set forth in this section
24 within a reasonable period of time after the controller refuses to take action
25 on such request;
26 (b) Ensure that the appeal process is conspicuously available and as easy to use
27 as the process for submitting a request to exercise a right under this section;
UNOFFICIAL COPY 22 RS BR 158
Page 14 of 32
XXXX Jacketed
1 (c) Inform the consumer of any action taken or not taken in response to the
2 appeal, along with a written explanation of the reasons in support thereof,
3 within thirty (30) days of receipt of an appeal. That period may be extended
4 by sixty (60) additional days where reasonably necessary, taking into
5 account the complexity and number of the requests serving as the basis for
6 the appeal. The controller shall inform the consumer of such an extension
7 within thirty (30) days of receipt of the appeal, together with the reasons for
8 the delay. The controller shall also provide the consumer with an e-mail
9 address or other online mechanism through which the consumer may
10 submit the appeal, along with any action taken or not taken by the
11 controller in response to the appeal and the controller's written explanation
12 of the reasons in support thereof, to the Attorney General; and
13 (d) When informing a consumer of any action taken or not taken in response to
14 an appeal pursuant to this subsection, clearly and prominently provide the
15 consumer with information about how to file a complaint with the
16 Consumer Protection Division of the Attorney General's office. The
17 controller shall maintain records of all such appeals and how it responded
18 to them for at least twenty-four (24) months and shall, upon request,
19 compile and provide a copy of such records to the Attorney General.

1 unlawful discrimination against consumers. A controller shall not
2 discriminate against a consumer for exercising any of the consumer rights
3 contained in this Section 3 of this Act, including denying goods or services,
4 charging different prices or rates for goods or services, or providing a
5 different level of quality of goods and services to the consumer. However,
6 nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a controller to
7 provide a product or service that requires the personal data of a consumer
8 that the controller does not collect or maintain or to prohibit a controller
9 from offering a different price, rate, level, quality, or selection of goods or
10 services to a consumer, including offering goods or services for no fee, if
11 the consumer has exercised his or her right to opt out pursuant to Section 3
12 of this Act or the offer is related to a consumer's informed, voluntary
13 participation in a bona fide loyalty, rewards, premium features, discounts,
14 or club card program;
15 (c) Not process sensitive data concerning a consumer for a non-exempt
16 purpose without the consumer having been presented with clear and

19 purposes of delivering a product or service requested by the parent of such
20 child, without processing such data in accordance with the federal
21 Children's Online Privacy Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. secs. 6501 et seq.; and
22 (d) Upon a request made by the Office of the Attorney General pursuant to any
23 investigation or action taken under Section 9 of this Act, provide the
24 Attorney General with the specific third parties, if any, with whom the
25 controller shares or sells personal data relevant to the Attorney General's
26 investigation or action, including:

1 party retains the data;
2 2. The length of time each third party retains the data; and
3 3. The use or uses to which the data is put by each third party.
4 (2) Any provision of a contract or agreement of any kind that purports to waive or
5 limit in any way consumer rights pursuant to Section 3 of this Act shall be
6 deemed contrary to public policy and shall be void and unenforceable.

8 meaningful privacy notice that includes:

7 (5) A controller shall establish in clear and plain language in a privacy notice one
8 (1) or more secure and reliable means for consumers to submit a request to
9 exercise their consumer rights under Section 3 of this Act. Such means shall take

14 class of consumers' actual or perceived race, color, ethnicity, religion, national

15 to the processor, by appropriate technical and organizational measures,
16 insofar as this is reasonably practicable, to fulfill the controller's obligation

23 processor pursuant to KRS 365.732 or any other applicable state and
24 federal law in order to meet the controller's obligations.
25 (2) A contract between a controller and a processor shall govern the processor's data
26 processing procedures with respect to processing performed on behalf of the
27 controller. The contract shall be binding and shall clearly set forth instructions

5 (a) Ensure that each person processing personal data is subject to a duty of
6 confidentiality with respect to the data;
7 (b) At the controller's direction, delete or return all personal data to the

16 (3) Determining whether a person is acting as a controller or processor with respect
17 to a specific processing of data is a fact-based determination that depends upon
18 the context in which personal data is to be processed. A processor that continues
19 to adhere to a controller's instructions with respect to a specific processing of

10 (3) Data protection impact assessments conducted under this section shall identify
11 and weigh the benefits that may flow directly and indirectly from the processing
12 of personal data to the controller, consumer, other stakeholders, and the public
13 against the potential risks to the rights of the consumer associated with such

15 reduce such risk. The use of de-identified data and the reasonable expectations of
16 consumers, as well as the context of the processing of personal data and the
