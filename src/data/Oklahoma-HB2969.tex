collection, which may be provided electronically by the consumer, to
collect a consumer's personal information.
B. A business may not collect an additional category of
personal information directly from the consumer or use personal
information collected for an additional purpose unless the business

C. If a third party that assumes control of all or part of a
business as described by subparagraph c of paragraph 2 of subsection
C of Section 3 of this act materially alters the practices of the
