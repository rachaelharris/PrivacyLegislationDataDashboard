 AN ACT to amend the general business law, in relation to the  management
   and oversight of personal data
 
   THE  PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK, REPRESENTED IN SENATE AND ASSEM-
 BLY, DO ENACT AS FOLLOWS:
 
   Section 1. Short title. This act shall be known and may  be  cited  as
 the "New York privacy act".
   ยง  2.  Legislative  intent.  1.  Privacy is a fundamental right and an
 essential element of freedom. Advances in technology have produced ramp-
 ant growth in the amount and categories of personal  data  being  gener-
 ated,   collected,  stored,  analyzed,  and  potentially  shared,  which
 presents both promise and peril. Companies collect, use  and  share  our
 personal  data  in  ways that can be difficult for ordinary consumers to
 understand. Opaque data processing policies make it impossible to evalu-
 ate risks  and  compare  privacy-related  protections  across  services,
 stifling  competition.  Algorithms  quietly make decisions with critical
 consequences for New York consumers, often with no human accountability.
 Behavioral advertising generates profits by turning people into products
 and their activity into assets. New York consumers deserve  more  notice
 and more control over their data and their digital privacy.
   2. This act seeks to help New York consumers regain their privacy.  It
 gives New York consumers the ability to exercise more control over their
 personal data and requires businesses to be responsible, thoughtful, and

 accountable  managers  of  that  information.  To achieve this, this act
 provides New York consumers a number  of  new  rights,  including  clear
 notice of how their data is being used, processed and shared; the abili-
 ty  to  access  and obtain a copy of their data in a commonly used elec-
 tronic format, with the ability to transfer  it  between  services;  the
 ability  to  correct  inaccurate  data and to delete their data; and the
 ability to challenge certain automated decisions. This act also  imposes
 obligations  upon  businesses  to  maintain reasonable data security for
 personal data, to notify New York consumers of foreseeable harms arising
 from use of their data and to obtain specific consent for that use,  and
 to conduct regular assessments to ensure that data is not being used for
 unacceptable purposes. These data assessments can be obtained and evalu-
 ated  by the New York State Attorney General, who is empowered to obtain
 penalties for violations of this act and prevent future violations. This
 act also grants New York consumers who have been injured as  the  result
 of  a  violation  a  private  right of action, which includes reasonable
 attorneys' fees to a prevailing plaintiff.
   ยง 3. The general business law is amended by adding a new article 42 to
 read as follows:
                                ARTICLE 42

 DISCRIMINATORY RESULTS ON THE BASIS OF A CONSUMER'S OR CLASS OF  CONSUM-
 ERS'  ACTUAL  OR  PERCEIVED  RACE,  COLOR, ETHNICITY, RELIGION, NATIONAL
 ORIGIN, SEX,  GENDER,  GENDER  IDENTITY,  SEXUAL  ORIENTATION,  FAMILIAL

 TRANSFER OR PROCESS ANY SUCH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION PROVIDED PURSUANT TO
 THIS SECTION FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE AND MUST DELETE ANY  SUCH  ADDITIONAL
 INFORMATION  WITHOUT UNDUE DELAY AND IN ANY EVENT WITHIN FORTY-FIVE DAYS

 CONSUMER. SUCH ASSESSMENT MUST IDENTIFY AND WEIGH THE BENEFITS THAT  MAY
 FLOW,  DIRECTLY  AND  INDIRECTLY, FROM THE PROCESSING TO THE CONTROLLER,
 THE CONSUMER, OTHER STAKEHOLDERS, AND THE PUBLIC AGAINST  THE  POTENTIAL
 RISKS  TO  THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER, OR CLASS OF CONSUMERS, ASSOCIATED
 WITH THE PROCESSING, AS MITIGATED BY SAFEGUARDS THAT THE CONTROLLER  CAN
 EMPLOY  TO  REDUCE  THE  RISKS.  THE  CONTROLLER  SHALL FACTOR INTO THIS
 ASSESSMENT THE USE OF DEIDENTIFIED DATA AND THE REASONABLE  EXPECTATIONS
 OF CONSUMERS, AS WELL AS THE CONTEXT OF THE PROCESSING AND THE RELATION-
 SHIP BETWEEN THE CONTROLLER AND THE CONSUMER WHOSE PERSONAL DATA WILL BE
 PROCESSED,  WITH  THE GOAL OF RESTRICTING OR PROHIBITING SUCH PROCESSING

 CONSUMERS, OR A CLASS OF CONSUMERS;
   (C)  A PHYSICAL OR OTHERWISE INTRUSION UPON THE SOLITUDE OR SECLUSION,
 OR THE PRIVATE AFFAIRS OR CONCERNS, OF CONSUMERS, WHERE  SUCH  INTRUSION
 WOULD BE OFFENSIVE TO A REASONABLE PERSON; OR
   (D) OTHER SUBSTANTIAL INJURY TO CONSUMERS.
   (B)  DUTY  OF  LOYALTY.  (I) A CONTROLLER MUST NOTIFY THE CONSUMER, OR
 CLASS OF CONSUMERS, OF THE INTEREST THAT MAY BE  HARMED  IN  ADVANCE  OF
 REQUESTING CONSENT AND AS CLOSE IN TIME TO THE PROCESSING AS PRACTICABLE
 WHERE  IT  IS  REASONABLY  FORESEEABLE  TO THE CONTROLLER THAT A PROCESS
 PRESENTS A HEIGHTENED RISK OF HARM TO THE CONSUMER OR CLASS  OF  CONSUM-
 ERS.
   (II) CONTROLLERS MUST NOT ENGAGE IN UNFAIR, DECEPTIVE, OR ABUSIVE ACTS
 OR  PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO OBTAINING CONSUMER CONSENT, THE PROCESSING
 OF PERSONAL DATA, AND A CONSUMER'S EXERCISE OF  ANY  RIGHTS  UNDER  THIS
 ARTICLE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION:
   (A)  DESIGNING A USER INTERFACE WITH THE PURPOSE OR SUBSTANTIAL EFFECT
 OF DECEIVING CONSUMERS, OBSCURING CONSUMERS' RIGHTS UNDER THIS  ARTICLE,
 OR  SUBVERTING OR IMPAIRING USER AUTONOMY, DECISION-MAKING, OR CHOICE IN
 ORDER TO OBTAIN CONSENT; OR
   (B) OBTAINING CONSENT IN A MANNER DESIGNED TO OVERPOWER  A  CONSUMER'S
 RESISTANCE; FOR EXAMPLE, BY MAKING EXCESSIVE REQUESTS FOR CONSENT.

   (I)  THE NATURE, SENSITIVITY AND CONTEXT OF THE PERSONAL DATA THAT THE
 CONTROLLER PROCESSES;
   (II) THE NATURE, PURPOSE, AND VALUE OF THE PROCESSES;
   (III) ANY RISKS OR HARMS TO CONSUMERS ACTUALLY OR POTENTIALLY  ARISING
 OUT  OF  THE PROCESSES, INCLUDING PHYSICAL, FINANCIAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, OR
 REPUTATIONAL HARMS;
   (IV) THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECT OF SAFEGUARDS IMPLEMENTED BY THE CONTROL-
 LERS;
   (V) THE SUFFICIENCY  OF  THE  CONTROLLER'S  NOTICES  TO  CONSUMERS  AT
 DESCRIBING AND OBTAINING CONSENT CONCERNING THE PROCESSES; AND
   (VI)  THE  ADEQUACY  OF  THE  SAFEGUARDS  AND  MONITORING PRACTICES OF
 PROCESSORS AND  THIRD  PARTIES  TO  WHOM  THE  CONTROLLER  HAS  PROVIDED
 PERSONAL DATA.
   (C) THE CONTROLLER MUST RETAIN RISK ASSESSMENTS FOR AT LEAST SIX YEARS
 AND  MAKE  RISK  ASSESSMENTS  AVAILABLE  TO  THE  ATTORNEY  GENERAL UPON

 ER'S  PERSONAL  DATA  TO  WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE A SERVICE OR GOOD

 (I) NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES OR GOODS REQUESTED BY THE  CONSUM-
 ER,  (II) NECESSARY FOR THE INTERNAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF THE CONTROL-
 LER AND CONSISTENT WITH THE DISCLOSURES MADE TO THE CONSUMER PURSUANT TO
 SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS ARTICLE, OR (III) NECESSARY TO COMPLY
 WITH THE LEGAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE CONTROLLER.
   (IV) CONTROLLERS SHALL BE UNDER A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO  ENGAGE  IN
 REASONABLE  MEASURES  TO  REVIEW THEIR ACTIVITIES FOR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT
 MAY HAVE ALTERED THEIR ABILITY TO IDENTIFY A SPECIFIC NATURAL PERSON AND
 TO UPDATE THEIR CLASSIFICATIONS OF DATA AS  IDENTIFIED  OR  IDENTIFIABLE
 ACCORDINGLY.
   (D) NON-DISCRIMINATION. (I) A CONTROLLER MUST NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
 A  CONSUMER  FOR  EXERCISING  RIGHTS  UNDER  THIS ACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
 LIMITED TO, BY:

 TRANSFER, OR SALE OF PERSONAL DATA TO ANY PROCESSOR, THE CONTROLLER MUST
 ENTER INTO A WRITTEN, SIGNED CONTRACT WITH THAT PROCESSOR. SUCH CONTRACT
 MUST BE BINDING AND CLEARLY SET FORTH INSTRUCTIONS FOR PROCESSING  DATA,
 THE  NATURE AND PURPOSE OF PROCESSING, THE TYPE OF DATA SUBJECT TO PROC-
 ESSING, THE DURATION OF PROCESSING, AND THE RIGHTS  AND  OBLIGATIONS  OF
 BOTH  PARTIES.  THE  CONTRACT  MUST  ALSO  INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT THE
 PROCESSOR MUST:
   (A) ENSURE THAT EACH PERSON PROCESSING PERSONAL DATA IS SUBJECT  TO  A
 DUTY OF CONFIDENTIALITY WITH RESPECT TO THE DATA;
   (B)  PROTECT  THE DATA IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF

 SOR WITH RESPECT TO A SPECIFIC PROCESSING OF DATA IS A FACT-BASED DETER-
 MINATION THAT DEPENDS UPON THE CONTEXT IN WHICH PERSONAL DATA IS  TO  BE
 PROCESSED.  A  PROCESSOR  THAT  CONTINUES  TO  ADHERE  TO A CONTROLLER'S
 INSTRUCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO A  SPECIFIC  PROCESSING  OF  PERSONAL  DATA
 REMAINS A PROCESSOR.

 CONSUMER  TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES THAT THE CONSUMER HAS NOT CONSENTED TO
 PURSUANT TO SUBDIVISION TWO OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF THIS  ARTI-
 CLE,  OR  IF  IT  CAN  REASONABLY EXPECT THAT ANY RIGHTS OF THE CONSUMER
 PROVIDED IN THIS ARTICLE WOULD BE COMPROMISED AS A RESULT OF SUCH TRANS-

 CONSUMER SUBMITTED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE BY A  CONSUMER  DIRECTLY  TO
 THE PROCESSOR TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROCESSOR HAS PROCESSED THE CONSUM-
 ER'S PERSONAL DATA SOLELY IN ITS ROLE AS A PROCESSOR FOR A CONTROLLER.
   (C)  PROCESSORS  SHALL  BE  UNDER A CONTINUING OBLIGATION TO ENGAGE IN
 REASONABLE MEASURES TO REVIEW THEIR ACTIVITIES  FOR  CIRCUMSTANCES  THAT

 ACCORDINGLY.

 THAN ON BEHALF OF THE CONTROLLER PURSUANT TO ANY AGREEMENT ENTERED  INTO

 ANY INQUIRY.

 TWO, SEVEN OR EIGHT OF SECTION ELEVEN HUNDRED TWO OF  THIS  ARTICLE  MAY
